# Rehearsal Space

Rehearsal Space is an all-in-one tool for music practice and song-writing.

See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for what it does.

## Running it

```sh
npm install
npm run dev          # live-reloading Electron app
npm run build        # typecheck + production build into out/
npm test             # vitest over the pure core
```

### Linux notes

Electron's SUID sandbox helper needs to be owned by root, which it is not in a
plain `npm install`. The `dev` and `start` scripts set `ELECTRON_DISABLE_SANDBOX=1`
to work around it. If you launch the binary by hand, pass `--no-sandbox`.

If `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` is set in your shell, Electron starts as plain Node and
`require('electron')` returns the npm helper instead of the real module. Unset it
(`env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE ...`).

### Looking at the UI without a screen

Setting `RS_CAPTURE=/path/shot.png` renders the window offscreen to a PNG and
exits. Useful on Wayland, over SSH, or in CI.

```sh
npm run build
env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE ELECTRON_DISABLE_SANDBOX=1 \
  RS_CAPTURE=/tmp/shot.png npx electron .
```

## Layout

```
src/
  main/      Electron main: windows, IPC, and (later) the job queue and library
  preload/   the one contextBridge surface
  shared/    the IPC contract, imported by both sides
  core/      pure TypeScript — no Electron, no DOM. This is where the tests are,
             and what a future mobile/web app reuses.
  renderer/  React UI and the audio engine
    ui/primitives   the two materials: raised things you touch, wells you read
    ui/shell        header, scrub bar, tool rail, stage, drawer, mixer dock
    ui/views        Library, Player, Setup
    ui/tools        the tool registry and each tool's panel
```
